## **About the `chemgraphbuilder` Package**

The `chemgraphbuilder` package is a powerful tool designed to facilitate the construction of knowledge graphs that represent complex chemical-gene interactions. This package is ideal for researchers and data scientists working in the fields of bioinformatics, cheminformatics, and computational biology. By providing a structured framework for integrating data on compounds, genes, proteins, and bioassays, `chemgraphbuilder` helps uncover the intricate relationships between these entities.

**Key features include:**

- **Node Representation:** Incorporates diverse nodes such as compounds, genes, proteins, and bioassays.
- **Comprehensive Relationships:** Maps out various interactions, including gene-protein relationships, bioassay-gene relationships, bioassay-compound relationships, compound similarities, compound co-occurrences in literature, and more nuanced interactions like inhibitor, activator, ligand, and other roles between compounds and genes.
- **Data Integration:** The knowledge graph schema is designed to support the integration of additional data sources, enhancing the depth and accuracy of the knowledge graph.
- **Command Line and Programmatic Access:** Provides flexibility in usage, allowing for integration into larger workflows or standalone analyses.
